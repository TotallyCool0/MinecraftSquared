# Minecraft Squared

Minecraft Squared (Minecraft^2 for short.) is a mod pack that adds fun features to spice up your Minecraft experience!
It primarily consists of vanilla-like mods that stay true to the feel of Minecraft, with a few exceptions.
It is built off of my mod pack Argon, which is a mod pack that uses Fabulously Optimized and a handful 
of other mods to increase performance, while adding a few other useful features, such as sound physics.

### I plan on adding more mods and replacing some mods as they get updated to 1.20.1.
